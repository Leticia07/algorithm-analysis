Brief 

Complexity calculation is a way of describing the efficiency of an algorithm. Each algorithm has its complexity and it can affect the execution time. To calculate the execution time we need to know the number of instructions that the algorithm will make and how many instructions the computer can execute per second.
The formula we use is:

In this code we can calculate the execution time of two algorithms:
- Insertion Sort
- Intercalation Sort
